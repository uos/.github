# Osnabrück University – Mobile Robotics

Welcome to the official GitHub for open source mobile robot software developed at the Osnabrück University.

We focus on cutting-edge research in robotics, 3D navigation, localization, and simulation. Our repositories offer tools and frameworks to support autonomous systems in unstructured environments.
